# Hello, I'm Jack Shkifati 👋

## About Me 🚀

Hello there, fellow GitHub user! 🙌 I'm Jack Shkifati, an enthusiastic and innovative Computer Engineer hailing from the vibrant city of New York. When I'm not pouring over data structures or tinkering with microcontrollers, you might find me exploring the city's food scene, diving into the latest physics book, or on the quest for the perfect espresso ☕

Ever since I can remember, I've had a deep-rooted passion for understanding how things work. I'm not just talking about software and electronics, but the fundamental laws that govern our universe. Physics has always been a subject close to my heart and understanding these principles gives me an unparalleled appreciation for the technology I work with. 🌌

I'm a proud alumni of NYU's Tandon School of Engineering and CUNY's Brooklyn College, where I was able to foster my love for engineering and physics alike. From C++ to Python, Arduino to Raspberry Pi, and databases to machine learning, I've got quite the technological arsenal up my sleeve! 💻

In the realm of technology, innovation, and impact, I've found my calling. Throughout my career, I've worked on diverse projects — from developing a bio-security system to predicting breast cancer survivability. And trust me, there's no thrill quite like the one you get when you see your code come to life! 🎯

On the professional front, I've made significant contributions as an Embedded Software Engineer, where I developed a device for non-invasive detection of skin abnormalities, enhancing accuracy in skin cancer screening. It's these projects where tech meets impact that get me really excited! 🌍

So, go ahead and explore my GitHub, check out my projects, and don't hesitate to reach out if you'd like to collaborate or just geek out about physics and tech. Let's create something awesome together! 👋

🎓 Graduated from New York University, Tandon School of Engineering.

  ### Embedded Sentry 🛡️ (Spring 2023)
  
  Developed a bio-security system using an STM32F429I-Discovery microcontroller and Mbed OS. This system leveraged an on-board gyroscope to record a unique hand movement sequence, creating a bio-based authentication method. Introduced the "Record Key" feature that stored the recorded sequence on the microcontroller, providing the basis for bio-authentication. Integrated the Dynamic Time Warping (DTW) algorithm to accurately recognize the movement sequence, which increased the robustness and repeatability of the system. Devised a user-friendly "enter key" and "record" functionality to guide the user through the process of recording and replicating the unlocking sequence.
  
  ### Air Ticket Reservation Web Application ✈️ (Spring 2023)
  
  Designed and developed a dual-interface Online Air Ticket Reservation System for both Customers and Airline Staff (Administrators) using Python Flask, MySQL, and HTML. Managed server-side operations, data management of flight details and user records, and created a user-friendly front-end, resulting in an efficient reservation process for all user types. Enabled customers to search for flights (one-way or round-trip), purchase flight tickets, view their future flight status, and access their past flight records, enhancing user convenience and autonomy. Designed administrator functionalities allowing Airline Staff to manage aviation operations, including adding new airplanes, creating new flights, and updating flight statuses.
  
  ### Modular Wearable System 👕 (Summer 2022)
  
  Collaborated with a team of 10 experts to create a wearable device applying non-invasive muscle signal decoding to aid individuals with physical or neurological impairments. Utilized sMMG to obtain myoelectric muscle signals and predict hand gestures and movements for personalized, real-time feedback. Enhanced wireless transmission from 50Hz to 2000Hz via implementation of User Datagram Protocol (UDP) and IoT integration.
  
  ### Breast Cancer Survivability Prediction 🎗️ (Fall 2022)
  
  Conducted a machine learning project using logistic regression, support vector machines, and neural networks to predict survivability of women with breast cancer at certain progression stages. Employed Supervised learning with Synthetic Minority Oversampling Technique (SMOTE) to balance the dataset and applied regularization techniques such as feature transformations to increase model accuracy.
  
  ### Blood Pressure Machine (Sphygmomanometer) 💉 (Spring 2022)
  
  Produced a measuring device that detects heart rate, systolic and diastolic blood pressure by connecting a Honeywell pressure sensor to an Adafruit Circuit Playground Classic microcontroller. Utilized Neo pixels to inform the user when the brachial artery's circulation is cut off and to keep cuff deflation rate at 2-3mmHg per second, as recommended by the American Hospital Association (AHA). Applied Communication protocol I2C to interface with the pressure sensor through GPIO pins.
  
  ### E20 Assembler / Processor Simulator/ Cache ⚙️ (Spring 2021)
  
  Developed a C++ program that reads assembly language and converts instructions into machine code. Created a processor simulator that reads machine code programs and executes instructions written in E20 assembly language. Designed a two-cache simulator with direct, n-associated, and fully-associated configurations to monitor the impact of an E20 application. Integrated a two-cache simulator with a Least Recently Used (LRU) cache replacement algorithm to improve cache hits.
  
  ### Traffic Light Controller 🚦 (Fall 2021)
